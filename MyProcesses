What is your programs parent process? 

If I were to run a process right now, the parent process would be the shell that I am using, 
in my case this would be bash. So the parent process would be my shell.



What is that process' parent process?


The parent process of my shell would be the init process, which as I have provided test results below,
has a pid of 1.



What is that process' parent process? 


The parent process of the init process would be the swapper process, as I have shown below. I know 
the it is the swapper process because it has pid of 0, which we know is reserved for the swapper process.
